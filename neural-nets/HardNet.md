# Summary

* **What:**
  * HardNet model which improves state-of-the-art in wide baseline stereo, patch matching, verification and image retrieval.
  * They introduced a new triplet-like loss function with built-in hard-negative mining.

* **How:**
  * HardNet Triplet loss is a regular Triplet-Loss, i.e. `MAX(0, alpha + distances_to_positives - distances_to_negatives)`, where:
    * `alpha` (sometimes called "margin") is a hyper-parameter
    * `distance_to_positives` are distances (here, L2 is used)
    * `distance_to_negative` are distances to the hardest negatives for each anchor in a batch.
  * As input HardNet operates with `N * 2` images (`N` anchor/query images and `N` corresponding to them positives)
  * Mining algorithm:
        1. Compute distance matrix `D` between N anchors and N positives.
        2. `distances_to_positives` = trace of distance matrix (diagonal elements)
        3. For each row minimal non-diagonal element is taken as a distance to the hardest negatives (closest to anchor). From these chosen values `distances_to_negatives` are obtained.
    * All this can be rewritten as:
      * `Loss = MAX(0, alpha + Trace(D) + row_wise_min(D + I * inf))`, where `I` is the identity matrix.
  * Architecture:

* **Notes:**
  * The described mining procedure highly relies on a fact that all `N` anchors would should to N different classes.
    And from my personal point of view requires minor modification to handle such corner case.
  * The given loss/mining procedure is fast, but in contrast to other mining strategies doesn't provide hardest positive (furthest from anchor).

* **Results:**
