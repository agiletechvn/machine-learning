# Summary

* **What**
  * They suggest a method to get cumulative/aggregated embedding from a sequence of embeddings (i.e get a single face embedding vector from a video).

* **How**
  * Use attention mechanism to weight embeddings in a sequence.
  * They suggest two options:
  	1. Single attention block – Universal face feature quality measurement.
       
       ![First attention](images/NAN_for_VideoFaceRecognition/NAN_first_attention_formula.png?raw=true "First attention formula") ![First attention](images/NAN_for_VideoFaceRecognition/NAN_first_attention_result.png?raw=true "First attention output")
       
       where *f_k* = embedding for k-th image in a sequence, *a_k* = obtained weight corresponded to k-th embedding
       
       Trainable parameter is: *q* (shape = embedding size x 1)
  	2. Cascaded two attention blocks – Content-aware aggregation.
  	
  	   ![Second attention](images/NAN_for_VideoFaceRecognition/NAN_second_attention_results.png?raw=true "Second attention output")
  	   
  	   This *q^1* replaces the q in above formula that computes coefficients *a_k*.
  	   
  	   Trainable parameters are: *W* (shape = embeddings size x embeddings size), *b* (shape = embedding size x 1).
  * Face embedder (could be any CNN) and "Attention blocks" can be trained together in end-to-end manner or separately one-by-one.
  * Training procedure: 
  	* For verification problem they used siamese structure with contrastive loss.
  	* For identification problem they used softmax and cross-entropy as loss function.
  * No recurrent blocks, but still input size independent.
  * Coefficients *a* (from the first attention block) strongly correlates with face quality and it's usefulness for recognition.

* **Results**
  * Shows better results than combining a single embedding by taking mean, median, l2/cos closest, etc.
  * Shows state-of-the-art performance on YouTubeFaces and IJB-A datasets.
